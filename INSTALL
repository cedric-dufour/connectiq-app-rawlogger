RawLogger (Garmin ConnectIQ) App
================================
Build and installation instructions

Please note these instructions are targeted towards *nix (Linux or Mac OS X)
command-liners (CLI).

If you are more comfortable with Windows or a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
please refer to the Garmin ConnectID Programmer's Guide:

  URL> https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/


Pre-Requesites
--------------

Download and install (decompress) the Garmin ConnectIQ SDK from Garmin website:

  URL> https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/

From here, we'll assume the SDK is located (decompressed) in:

  PATH> /opt/connectiq-sdk-linux


Get hold of RawLogger source code:

  URL> https://github.com/cedric-dufour/connectiq-app-rawlogger


If you haven't already done so, generate a ConnectIQ developer key:

  CLI> UMASK=$(umask); umask 077  # you developer key is SECRET!

  CLI> mkdir ~/.secret

  CLI> openssl genrsa \
        -out ~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.pem 4096

  CLI> openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -inform PEM -outform DER \
        -in  ~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.pem \
        -out ~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.der 

  CLI> umask ${UMASK}


Build Environment
-----------------

We'll be using GNU make to build and install the project:

  URL> https://www.gnu.org/software/make/


The following environment variables are available for you to fine-tune the
build environment:

  CIQ_ROOT := /opt/connectiq-sdk-linux
    Garmin ConnectIQ SDK installation folder

  CIQ_MONKEYC := ${CIQ_ROOT}/bin/monkeyc
    Monkey C compiler

  CIQ_SIMULATOR := ${CIQ_ROOT}/bin/simulator
    ConnectIQ simulator

  CIQ_MONKEYDO := ${CIQ_ROOT}/bin/monkeydo
    ConnectIQ simulation launcher

  CIQ_SDK := 2.4.0
    Target SDK version

  CIQ_DEVICE := d2charlie
    Target device

  CIQ_DEVKEY := [no default]

(please see the Makefile.ciq file for more details)


A little help before getting started may be welcome:

  CLI> make help


Debug Build and Simulation
--------------------------

Build the project, including debug symbols:

  SH> export CIQ_DEVKEY=~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.der

  SH> make debug

Launch the project in the device simulator:

  SH> make run-debug


Release Build and Installation
------------------------------

Build the project, excluding debug symbols:

  SH> export CIQ_DEVKEY=~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.der

  SH> make release

Connect your device via USB (as USB storage) and install the application:

  SH> export DESTDIR=/path/to/device  # NOT including /Garmin/Apps sub-path

  SH> make install


Alternate devices
-----------------

RawLogger is being developed primarily for and using a D2 Charlie device.

However, you can readily build and install it on any "compatible" device
(featuring ConnectIQ 2.1 and above), e.g. the Fenix 5X:

  SH> export CIQ_DEVICE=fenix5x
  SH> export CIQ_SDK=2.4.0


Enjoy!

Quirks
------

On Debian 8 (Jessie), you will need the libjpeg8 package from Debian 7 (Wheezy)
to be able to run the ConnectIQ simulator:

  URL> https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/libjpeg8

On Debian 9 (Stretch), you will also need the libpng12-0 package from Debian 8 (Jessie):

  URL> https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libpng12-0
